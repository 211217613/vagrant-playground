# Notes

This VM has some example code on how to connect into a vagrant machine using [Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). As of writing this is supported in vscode insiders, and requires installation of at least two extensions. See the instructions linked above on how to set that all up. Once you're done, you must hange the absolute paths in `.vscode/settings.json` and `ssh_config`. (The `ssh_config` file can be automatically regenerated using `vagrant ssh-config`)
