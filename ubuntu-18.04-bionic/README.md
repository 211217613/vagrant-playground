# Notes

This VM has some example code on how to connect into a vagrant machine using [Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). See the instructions linked above on how to set it up. Once you're done, you must change the absolute paths in `.vscode/settings.json` and `ssh_config`. (The `ssh_config` file can be automatically regenerated using `vagrant ssh-config`)
